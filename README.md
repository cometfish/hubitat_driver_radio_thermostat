# Radio Thermostat driver

Hubitat Driver for controlling [Radio Thermostat CT50](https://www.radiothermostat.com/product-page/ct50-wi-fi-smart-thermostat) (also known as Filtrete 3M-50) locally, with no hub or cloud connection required.  
This driver was ported from [statusbits' SmartThings driver](https://github.com/statusbits/smartthings).

1. Add `radio_thermostat.groovy` to your Hubitat as a new Driver (under `Drivers Code`)
2. Add a new device for your Thermostat to your Hubitat, set device Type to your User driver of 'Radio Thermostat'
3. Assign your thermostat a static IP, and enter the IP into the device's `Thermostat IP Address` setting in Hubitat.
5. Pressing Refresh on the device in Hubitat should now load the current state. Enjoy :)
